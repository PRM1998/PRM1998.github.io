README.txt:

I believe that everything I have written is correct with regards to functionality, however I feel as 
though I could have commented more throughout the program. The program seemed fairly straightforward 
and therefore I was unsure if any comments were truly necessary. Additionally, I am not sure if I 
indented and spaced my program well. Finally, I wish I had been able to change the spacing between 
paragraphs and headers throughout the html files. 

I worked next to Thomas Chang-Davidson and saw TA's Manish and Robert.

I spent roughly 6 hours on this assignment, most of which was simply learning how to use github, git, 
and recognizing I needed a shell linux terminal.
